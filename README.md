A serious game for promoting environmentally sustainable behaviors through empathy, embedded in a web-app that supports it. 

While the game was developed with Unity, the web-app itself is based on a MEAN stack framework:
 - The front-end consists of an Angular single-page application that embeds the game in Unity WebGL format.
 - The back-end consists of an Express.js application server running on top of Node.js, and a MongoDB database.

Both front-end and back-end are hosted on Render.
Developed in the context of my Masterâ€™s thesis.
